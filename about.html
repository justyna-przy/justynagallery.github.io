                    <h1>Hello, thanks for visiting my gallery.</h1>

                    <p>
                        My passion for Art and drawing has grown rapidly over the years, so i have decided to share my work with the world.
                        This website displays the developement of my style through my final years of secondary school.
                        My art ranges from portraits, to object studies and the mediums i used have been varied too! - acrylic, watercolour, oil pastel and colouring pencil.
                        However, my realistic style remains consistant.

                        Due to covid, art galleries were forced to go online, many of them adapted and created virtual art galleries.
                        I was inspired by this movement and decided to create my own immersive virtual art gallery.
                        A 3D video tour of my virtual exhibition can be found in the gallery tab. I hope you enjoy my tour!
